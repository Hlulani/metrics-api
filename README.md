# Getting Started running Advertising Data ETL-V backend

This backend is not written in Django as per the challenge document and the reason for this is because as we have communicated on the initial call, I am to be tested for the front-end work so I have written this in Nodejs so I can be able to pull the data to use on the front-end 

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open Base URL[http://localhost:3000/api/csv](http://localhost:3000/api/csv) to view it in the browser or postman.
